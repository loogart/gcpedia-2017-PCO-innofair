                                <h5>Advancing Self-Determination through Recognition of Rights and Self-Determination Discussions - At INAC, in the context of reconciliation, we are bringing more people around the table to develop innovative ways of working together to reach the best possible outcomes for all. One of the ways we are innovating is through Recognition of Rights and Self-Determination Discussions. Canada’s primary policy tools for addressing Aboriginal rights and advancing reconciliation have been the Comprehensive Land Claims and Inherent Right policies. While these policies have guided negotiations to reaching a number of modern treaties and self-government agreements, they have also been largely criticized for being inflexible and unresponsive to the unique circumstances of First Nations, Inuit and Métis groups. In response to calls from Indigenous groups for alternate and more flexible tools to address their rights and interests, Canada has established Exploratory Tables with a number of First Nations, Inuit and Métis groups across the country to advance their journey to self- determination as a partnership that is premised on recognizing rights, respect, and being more responsive. These discussions are concrete ways of expressing the Crown’s commitment to renewing the relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Métis through dialogue and jointly setting priorities at the community level. These Tables also offer concrete examples of areas for future policy reform. As discussions evolve, Canada and Indigenous groups move closer towards reconciling and renewing nation-to-nation relationships based on the recognition of the rights and interests of Indigenous groups, but as important in a spirit of respect, cooperation and partnership.

                    <p>The Reconciliation Secretariat will host an interactive dialogue on reconciliation and what it means as Canada enters the next 150 years. Participants will be invited to listen and engage with Indigenous Elders and invited to reflect on what reconciliation means for each of us as individuals, in our work, in our community, as public servants and as Canadians. The dialogue will engage participants to reflect on how to build relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect and cooperation and how this can impact their work in a positive way. The dialogue will challenge participants to think about the way we work in the Public Service and its impact on the process of reconciliation with the goal of inspiring innovative thinking.
